# Solomon 

Solomon is a growing ecosystem of 'hyperlocal' technologies, built using [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) and easily combined to create powerful tools and projects for use on the web.

Solomon was born out of partnerships with large organisations looking to make Open Data easy to understand. We released our interactive Dashboard product with the first full-scale Solomon implementation, [Leeds City Dashboard](http://dashboard.leedsdatamill.org), which is currently in Beta.

#Leeds City Dashboard

##An Open Data Dashboard for Leeds
Leeds City Dashboard makes Open Data, primarily from [Leeds Data Mill](http://www.leedsdatamill.org), easy to reach and understandable for all. The project is the result of a partnership between [Leeds City Council](http://www.leeds.gov.uk) and [Hebe Works](http://www.hebeworks.com) and has been made possible thanks to funding from [Local Government Association](http://www.local.gov.uk) and the [Department for Communities and Local Government](http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government).

##An Open Source initiative
Solomon is a growing ecosystem of 'hyperlocal' technologies, built using [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) and easily combined to create powerful tools and projects for use on the web. Solomon was born out of partnerships with large organisations looking to make Open Data easy to understand.
